 		* of bouncing in a diagonal direction away from the wall as well.
 		*
 		* If the yarn comes into contact with another block in it's travels it will
 		* bounce off of those the same way, reflecting off them with random chance
 		* of varying in it's path.
 		* This continues until something happens to the yarn that removes it from the game.
